# LazySusanCabinet-
Misson Statment: 

Smart homes are the future for housing and living. Smart home system connects your applications to automate specific tasks. These applications can cost hundreds if not
thousands of dollars. Our advisor challenged us to recreate one smart home application but with a budget of only 30 dollars. For that, we decided to recreate a
Lazy Susan Cabinet which is essentially a rotating cabinet shelf (two carousels) that can hold spices and jars. The idea is that it makes the organization of kitchen 
condiditments neater and more accessible. A typical lazy susan costs nearly 300 dollars. We recreated one (through Arudino, stepper motors, 3d printed gears, 
CNC router/wood) that cost nearly a 10th of that.
